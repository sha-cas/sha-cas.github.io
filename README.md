# Homework 1: Code with AI

The due date is Feb 13 at midnight. If you are using the late days, please note in the head of README.md that “I used XX late days this time, and I have XX days remaining”.

The main purpose of this homework is to help you:

- Get experience with AI coding
- Learn how to decompose a problem into smaller tasks and find the right tools to solve them with the help of AI
- Improve your prompt engineering skills
- Conduct the coding task you have never learned before with the help of AI

**Remark**: We expect you to complete the homework with the help of AI. The tips we provide are just suggestions, and you can use other tools to complete the tasks. This homework might take longer than you expect if you have no experience with web development or GitHub Actions. Though this is exactly what we expect you to experience: to finish the coding tasks that you have never learned before, we suggest you **start early** in case you face unexpected issues.

Your homework repository should have all the source code for the problems below, though the real website could be based on the repository hosted under your own GitHub account.

In the `README.md` of your homework repository, you can write the report section as a case-study tutorial on how to use AI copilot for the following three problems. You can list the AI tools  you used, and how you designed and adjusted your prompts. You can add screenshots or even share the video of how you used these AI tools and the intermediate products generated by AI if you believe it will help the readers learn.



## Problem 1. Github Website for Your Coding Blog

Create a homepage for a website for your **coding blog**. The website should be hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). You can design the homepage by yourself in any proper style you like. You may need to make the design expandable to add more content from our future assignments. The link to the homepage should be added to the `README.md` of your homework repository so that anyone can access the homepage and the following two webpages from the Internet using this link.

Here is the link: https://sha-cas.github.io/

## Problem 2. Game Coding: Pac-Man

Add a new page to your website for [Pac-Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man). The users can directly play the Pac-Man game on your webpage. As long as people can recognize it as some variation of the Pac-Man game by common sense, you can decide how complicated the game should be by yourself. The link to the game webpage should be added to the homepage in Problem 1.

## Problem 3. Data Scaffolding from the Internet

Add a new page to your website for auto-updating the latest papers from arXiv with the keywords you are interested in. This webpage should have the following features:

- The webpage should list the latest papers from arXiv with the keywords you pick. You can decide on the paper list style by yourself.
- The list should include paper titles, authors, abstracts, and direct links to PDFs.
- The paper list should be auto-updated every midnight by updating the latest papers from arXiv.
- The link to the webpage should be added in the homepage in Problem 1.
- Design the webpage by yourself in any proper style you think the readers would like.

**Tip 1**: You can ask AI how to deploy the website by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). 

**Tip 2**: You can ask AI to teach you how to use [arXiv API](https://arxiv.org/help/api/user-manual) to fetch the latest papers from arXiv.

**Tip 3**: You can ask AI to teach you how to use [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to automate the process of updating the webpage.

**Tip 4**: You can use [Copy Coder](https://copycoder.ai/) to help you design the webpage UI from the style you like.
